# File Remover and Renamer

This is a pyhton script for removing multiple files with a partcilar extension.
It will remove files with selected extension asked from user at runtime.

For Renaming/Removing Particlar Characters/Words From Multiple file names.
Enter Target Characters To Be Replaced With New Characters (empty from just removing characters).

## My Use Case

Personally I Made This Script For Removing Multiple Subtitle Files From Downloaded Movies or Courses or Series.
I Needed This Because Copying The Said Files Takes a lot of time due to large file numbers with small size.
This hinders the processiong power (Copying & Cuting & pasting) of any device and takes more time than actually required for the data this size.

## Specifications

This Code Uses Threads To Explore All Subdirectories Starting From The Directory This File is Placed at.
The Deleted Files Will Not Be Moved To RecycleBin They Will Be Deleted Permanently.


# Warning 

Use It On Your Own Risk.
The Code will explore all 'Subdirectories' and Rename files with 'particular extension and particular characters'.
If some 'particular characters' are not found in 'file name with specific extennsion' the file will be 'Permanently Deleted In this Case'
